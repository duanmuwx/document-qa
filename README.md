# DocumentIQA: Scientific Document Insight Question/Answer

## Introduction

Question/Answering on scientific documents.
In our implementation we use [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) for text extraction instead of the raw PDF2Text converter.
Thanks to Grobid we are able to precisely extract abstract and full-text.
This is just the beginning and publishing might help gathering more feedback. 

**NOTE**: This project focus on scientific articles. Uploading books or other large document might not work as expected.
