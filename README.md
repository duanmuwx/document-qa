# DocumentIQA: Document Insight Question/Answer

## Introduction

Question/Answering on documents. Upload your document and ask questions. 
In our implementation we use [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) for text extraction instead of the raw PDF2Text converter.
Thanks to Grobid we are able to precisely extract abstract and full-text. 
This is just the beginning and publishing might help gathering more feedback.
